DAX, SQL, and Portfolio Examples

This repository display some examples of SQL and DAX.
Within each folder are examples with comments to explain the purpose and provide details into the construction of the code.

The folder for Portfolio and Images contains a copy of my resume, an image of a Power BI Dashboard that is utilized as a weekly emailer, and my Portfolio that showcases some Power BI Data Modeling, additional DAX measures, and then examples of dashboards I have created in the past.
The final slide of the Portfolio has a link to my Full Sail University video portfolio that shows dashboards created during my time there in action.
